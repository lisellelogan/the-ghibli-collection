# The Ghibli Collection

## Description
The Ghibli Collection was inspired by IMDb and created with hopes of easily allowing someone to see a short description of a Studio Ghibli film.

This app allows the user to choose from a collection of Studio Ghibli films and give information about the title, movie description, director, producer, and most importantly, the rotten tomato score for each individual movie.

Through this information, the user will then be able to determine which film peaks their interest the most and slowly turn them into a Studio Ghibli fanatic. The Ghibli Collection uses the Studio Ghibli API from https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/ in order to provide a database of Studio Ghibli films.

This Ghibli Collection was written using Ruby.
